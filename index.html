                Our Mission:
            </h3>
            <p class="desc">
                At <i>Eargift</i> we love music more than words could ever do justice. <u>We're annoying about it.</u>
                When we find something we like we <strong>REALLY</strong> don't shut up about it. But we accept that about ourselves.<br> 
                Our goal is to give the people like us a place to discuss music, voice their opinions, and rate their top songs, 
                artists, and albums.

                Sometimes a number just isn't enough to convey how much love you have for that song you heard
                on your way to work, and you want to express yourself in words.<br> On Eargift you can review your favorite music, and share 
                that review with our community.<br>We then analyze that review to determine how much you and your music really vibe.

                By connecting your Spotify account and reviewing your music on our page,<br> we can get a general sense for your music taste,
                beyond what the algorithm overlords are pushing you. When you write a review on Eargift your review gets analyzed by our<br> 
                Natural Language Processing algorithms for sentiment analysis, tone analysis, along with other factors to help capture your 
                musical interests in ways streaming services don't.
