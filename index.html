                Our Mission:
            </h3>
            <p>
                At Eargift we love music more than words could ever do justice. We're annoying about it. 
                When we find something we like we REALLY don't shut up about it. But we accept that about ourselves. 
                Our goal is to give the people like us a place to discuss music, voice their opinions, and rate their top songs, 
                artists, and albums. 
            </p>

                What do we do?>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sometimes a number just isn't enough to convey how much love you have for that song you heard
                on your way to work, and you want to write about it? On Eargift you can review your favorite music, and share 
                that review with our community. We then analyze that review to determine how much you and your music really vibe.

            </h3>
            <p>
                By connecting your Spotify account and reviewing your music on our page, we can get a general sense for your music taste,
                beyond what the algorithm overlords are pushing you. When you write a review on Eargift your review gets analyzed by our 
                Natural Language Processing algorithms for sentiment analysis, tone analysis, along with other factors to help capture your 
                musical interests in ways streaming services don't.
